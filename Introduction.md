Going solo is tough. Drag a buddy in and make it a game! Create tasks, check in daily, climb the scoreboard — whether it's splitting chores or crushing fitness goals, Cherries turns sticking with it into a multiplayer game you can't put down.

How It Works

  🏰 Create a Quest
  Name your challenge, set a date range, and list your daily tasks. Assign points to each
  one: dishes 5 pts, running 10 pts, reading 30 min 8 pts… your game, your rules.

  👥 Invite Your Partner-in-Crime
  The app generates a 9-digit invite code. Toss it to your partner, roommate, bestie, or
  mom — anyone can become your rival (sorry, teammate).

  ✅ Daily Check-In
  A clean calendar view tells the whole story: green dot means great job, red dot means…
  well, try harder tomorrow. One tap to check in — faster than posting a story.

  🏆 Live Scoreboard
  Points update in real time. Gold, silver, bronze — all laid out crystal clear. Nothing
  fuels motivation quite like "I'm beating you by 3 points."

  📊 Stats & Streaks
  Current streak, total points, longest streak ever — let the numbers show you that you're
   more consistent than you thought.

  Perfect For

  - 💑 Couples splitting chores — settle the "who does more" debate once and for all with
  data
  - 🏠 Roommates sharing housework — fair, transparent, no more playing dead
  - 💪 Gym buddies — skip your run today and the scoreboard will trash-talk for me
  - 📚 Study groups — reading, flashcards, practice sessions — can't grind alone? drag
  someone in
  - 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families building habits — turn "why didn't you do it again" into "I won again
  today"turns sticking with it into a multiplayer game you can't put down.
